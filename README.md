How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

- When writing programs, it is important to make sure that you create something that is maintainable, readable and adaptable.  After working through the projects in this course, having an adaptable program was crucial. Writing programs that meet these requirements entail using blocks of code that you can easily change the lines of code and make it work with other programs.  With this Python module, it can now be used with several other programs by adjusting the databases that it intends to work with.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?



What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
